# Skills and Interest
During my second year at university i had a group  project assignment. Each member choose a role they think they would fit in and i choose a role of being a secretary. My role was to make sure that minutes of the meeting were taken in each and every meeting we had, i choose this role so that it can help me understand my interest and skills. During our project i quickly noticed that i enjoyed my role as it allowed me to have a clear communication with my group members on what was discussed and when will the next meeting take place.
