# Carrer Reflections
I lacked clarity on which path would best align with my goals, interest and values. I was excited when i was tasked to complete a work readiness in carrer development. My goal was to get a better understanding of my carrer goals, interest and identify roles that would suit my skills and interest. I completed a selft assessment exercise and a quizz, that helped me to understand the importance of setting goals.
The carrer development session really improved my confidence regarding my carrer direction, it also helped me to discover that i do well in activities and roles that  involves problem solving, communication and working as a team.

# Skills and Interest
During my second year at university i had a group  project assignment. Each member choose a role they think they would fit in and i choose a role of being a secretary. My role was to make sure that minutes of the meeting were taken in each and every meeting we had, i choose this role so that it can help understand my interest and skills. During our project i quickly noticed that i enjoyed my role as it allowed me to have a clear communication with my group members on what was discussed and when will the next meeting take place. Not so long ago i completed a skills and interest task that we were given at university and it helped me a lot to discover some interest and skills that i have. The experience helped me to identify my strong interest and skills, it also showed me that i have streghts in leadership and communication.

# Personality Assessment
As a final year student at my university i was given a task to complete a personality assessment. The purpose of this assessment was to help me understand my personal traits and how they influence or have an impact in learning, communication and carrer preferences.
My task was to complete the assessment and also do some quizzes about my personality, after completing the assessment i discovered my personality traits that i am organised, sensitive, strong and i focus on purpose driven work.
